# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture significant architectural decisions made in this project, along with the context and consequences of each decision.

---

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a short document that records:

- **The context**: What problem were we solving? What constraints existed?
- **The decision**: What did we choose to do?
- **The consequences**: What are the trade-offs? What becomes easier or harder?

ADRs are written **before** implementing the decision, not after.

---

## When to Write an ADR

Write an ADR when making a decision that:

- Affects more than one service
- Changes or establishes a data layer (database choice, schema strategy)
- Changes infrastructure (new AWS service, changing queue broker)
- Changes API protocol or communication pattern between services
- Adds a new shared package or cross-service dependency
- Changes authentication/authorization strategy
- Is something a future contributor would ask "why did we do it this way?"

**Exempt**: Implementation details within a single service that don't affect others.

## ADR Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Accepted → Deprecated → Superseded
              ↓
           (in use)
```

- **Proposed**: Written, under review
- **Accepted**: Approved and in effect
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended but still technically in use
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer ADR (link to the superseding ADR)

ADRs are **never deleted**. They are a historical record.

## How to Write an ADR

1. Find the next sequential number: look at the highest number in this directory
2. Copy the template format from `0001-monorepo-structure.md`
3. Name it: `[NNNN]-[short-kebab-case-title].md`
4. Fill in the sections
5. Set status to `Proposed`
6. Submit as part of the PR that implements the decision
7. Update status to `Accepted` when the PR is merged
